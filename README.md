# Color Reduction Art

## Description
This is a fun little program that will take a list of colors that you provide (in Colors.py) and an image that you provide,
and reduce every pixel to the nearest color in 3d vector space.

## Dependencies
* Python3
  * matplotlib
## Usage (under construction)
 ```
 python3 ColorReducer.py <name of image>
 ```
 To define the set of colors you'd like to reduce to, enter them as a list into Colors.py.

For testing, there is a hex boolean variable that you can explicitly set to use rgb or hex.
